The betel market in Sri Lanka encompasses the cultivation and trade of both betel leaves and areca nuts, integral components of the traditional practice of chewing betel quid. Betel vines are cultivated throughout the country, with commercial production of high-quality leaves, known as "kalu bulath," concentrated in districts such as Kurunegala, Gampaha, Kegalle, Kalutara, and Colombo. These leaves are typically sold in bundles of 1,000 at wholesale markets. ​
